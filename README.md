# facedetector
A simple Python project that can detect faces using a webcam


The default camera can be changed by changing 'webcam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)' to 1 or 2 if you have multiple cameras.
IP Cameras can also be used by replacing the 0 with the link to the direct video feed of the cam, the link to a console will NOT work.
